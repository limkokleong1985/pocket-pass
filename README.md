# Pocket Pass – Offline Hardware Password Vault

Pocket Pass is a small **offline hardware password manager** built on ESP32‑S3.  
It stores your secrets on a microSD card, protects them with **AES‑256‑GCM** and a **6‑digit passcode**, and acts as a **USB keyboard** to type passwords into your computer.  
No Wi‑Fi, no cloud, no telemetry – everything stays on your device.

## Main Features

### Security & Cryptography

- **Fully offline** – no network stack is used; all data lives on the SD card.
- **Per‑device secret** stored in a dedicated NVS partition (`device_secrets`).
- **6‑digit PIN** required to unlock the vault.
- **Recovery Key** (Base64) that, combined with the PIN, allows recovery or migration.
- **Key derivation:**
  - PBKDF2‑HMAC‑SHA256 with configurable iterations (security level 1–9).
  - HKDF‑SHA256 for subkey derivation.
- **Encryption:**
  - AES‑256‑GCM for all sensitive data.
  - Separate subkeys for:
    - `K_fields` – passwords.
    - `K_db` – DB‑related encryption (reserved).
    - `K_meta` – encrypted names/labels metadata.
- **Device binding:** copying the SD card alone is not enough; you also need:
  - The 6‑digit PIN, and
  - The Recovery Key, and
  - The device‑specific secret in NVS.

### Vault & Password Management

- **Categories & items:**
  - Up to **60 categories**.
  - Up to **60 passwords per category**.
- **Per‑item features:**
  - Name (label) and password stored in an encrypted SQLite database on SD.
  - **Password rotation** with optional history.
  - **Password history archives** – browse and resend/show previous passwords.
- **Password generation:**
  - Configurable counts for:
    - Uppercase letters
    - Lowercase letters
    - Numbers
    - Symbols
  - Generated passwords are shuffled for better entropy distribution.

### User Interface & UX

- **Display:** ST7789 TFT display with simple menu UI.
- **Input:**
  - Rotary encoder for navigation.
  - Multiple buttons: Back, Select, Up, Down.
  - On‑device text input UI for:
    - PIN entry (6‑digit passcode),
    - Naming categories & accounts,
    - Manual password entry,
    - Recovery key entry, etc.
- **Auto‑lock:**  
  - **Auto logout after 5 minutes** of inactivity (`AUTO_LOGOUT_MS = 5 min`).
  - On auto‑lock, sensitive keys are wiped and the device reboots to the PIN screen.

### USB & SD Card

- **USB HID Keyboard:**
  - Types passwords and recovery keys into the host like a normal keyboard.
- **USB Mass Storage (MSC) SD Card Mode:**
  - Special “Access SD Card” mode in Settings.
  - Reboots into an MSC bridge (`ESP32S3_USBMSC_SDMMC`) so the SD card appears as a USB drive.
  - Ideal for:
    - Backups (copying the DB file off the SD),
    - Restoring from backup.
- **SD card‑backed SQLite database:**
  - Uses Arun’s `Sqlite3Esp32` library.
  - Migrates old plaintext names into encrypted meta tables (`category_meta`, `item_meta`) and can wipe plaintext names after migration.

### Firmware Updates

- **Offline firmware updates from SD card:**
  - Place `firmware.bin` and `firmware.sig` in:
    - `/pocketPass/firmware/firmware.bin`
    - `/pocketPass/firmware/firmware.sig`
  - Firmware is verified using **ECDSA P‑256** with a built‑in public key (`ECDSA_P256_PUBLIC_KEY_PEM`) and the **SHA‑256** hash of the binary.
  - Only correctly signed firmware is accepted, then flashed via the Arduino `Update` API.

### Lockout & Optional Self‑Destruct

- **PIN attempt limiting:**
  - After **6 failed PIN attempts** (`PIN_MAX_FAILS = 6`), the device enters a **lockout** state.
  - In lockout, only Recovery Mode is allowed.
- **Optional self‑destruct (compile‑time):**
  - `PP_SELF_DESTRUCT_ON_LOCKOUT` (default `0`).
  - If enabled and max PIN attempts are exceeded, critical meta data can be scrambled so **neither PIN nor Recovery Key can ever unlock the vault again**.

## Simple DIY Build Guide

This is a **high‑level** guide for people who want to build their own Pocket Pass device.

### 1. Assemble the Hardware

1. **Choose an ESP32‑S3 board**  
   - Must support native USB (TinyUSB).  
   - Provide access to the GPIO pins listed above.

2. **Wire the ST7789 display**  
   - Connect SPI lines (MOSI/SCLK/CS/DC/RESET/BL) per your display and board.  
   - Ensure the `Display_ST7789` library is configured for your wiring and screen size.

3. **Add the rotary encoder & buttons**
   - Connect encoder A/B pins to:
     - `GPIO4` and `GPIO5` (as per `ENC_PIN_A/B`).
   - Connect push buttons to:
     - `BTN_BACK   -> GPIO9`
     - `BTN_SELECT -> GPIO6`
     - `BTN_UP     -> GPIO3`
     - `BTN_DOWN   -> GPIO7`
   - Use pull‑ups (`INPUT_PULLUP`) as in the code and wire buttons to ground.

4. **Connect the microSD card**
   - Use an SDMMC‑compatible microSD socket.
   - Wire SD lines according to your ESP32‑S3 board reference and the pins used in the code
     (see SDMMC config in `bootMSCMode()`).

5. **USB connection**
   - Connect the board’s USB‑C / micro‑USB to your PC.
   - This will be used both for flashing firmware and for USB HID / MSC operation.

---

### 2. Set Up the Firmware Build Environment

1. **Install Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO)**.
2. **Install ESP32 board support**:
   - Add Espressif’s board URL and install the ESP32 core (S3‑capable).
3. **Clone or download this repository**:
   - Put all `.ino` and `.h` files into one Arduino sketch folder.
   - Each `.ino` file may be a separate tab (e.g. `main.ino`, `10_app_decl.ino`, etc.).
4. **Install required libraries**:
   - From the Arduino Library Manager or manually:
     - `Display_ST7789`
     - `SimpleRotaryController`
     - `RotaryMarqueeMenu`
     - `TextInputUI`
     - `Sqlite3Esp32` (Arun’s)
     - `ESP32S3_USBMSC_SDMMC`
5. **Partition table (important)**:
   - The firmware uses a dedicated NVS partition named **`device_secrets`** for the per‑device key:
     - Ensure your partition scheme defines an NVS partition with the label `device_secrets`.
     - Alternatively, use the partition table provided by this project (if included in the repo).

---

### 3. Build & Flash

1. Select the correct **Board** (ESP32‑S3 variant) and **Port** in Arduino IDE.
2. Select the partition scheme that includes the `device_secrets` partition.
3. Compile the sketch.
4. Upload the firmware to the ESP32‑S3.

Once flashing is complete, the device should reboot into the Pocket Pass welcome screen.

---

### 4. First Boot & Initial Setup

On first boot (no existing vault):

1. **Welcome information**  
   - The device shows a welcome/info screen explaining the 6‑digit PASSCODE and Recovery Key.
2. **Set your 6‑digit PIN**
   - You will be asked to:
     - Enter a 6‑digit PIN.
     - Confirm the same PIN again.
3. **Choose Security Level (KDF iterations)**
   - You’ll be prompted for a **security level 1–9**:
     - 1 = faster, fewer PBKDF2 iterations.
     - 9 = slower, more secure.
4. **Recovery Key**
   - A unique Recovery Key (Base64) is generated and shown **once**.
   - **Write it down or store it securely**.
   - You can also send it via USB HID to your PC using the on‑screen option.
5. **Vault initialization**
   - A new encrypted SQLite vault is created on the SD card.
   - Device secrets and KDF metadata are stored.
6. **Main menu**
   - You are taken to the main **Categories** screen.

From now on, every boot will go through the **Unlock** flow unless the device is locked out.

---

### 5. Daily Usage

#### Unlocking

1. Enter your **6‑digit PIN**.
2. If successful:
   - The vault key is unwrapped.
   - Subkeys are derived.
   - Categories & items are loaded from the encrypted DB.
3. If the PIN is wrong:
   - The failure counter increases.
   - After 6 failures, the device locks out and requires Recovery Mode.

#### Recovery Mode

If you forget your PIN or the device is locked out:

1. Select **“Enter Recovery Mode”** from the unlock failed screen.
2. Enter:
   - The **correct 6‑digit PIN** you used originally.
   - Your **Recovery Key** (Base64 string).
3. If both are correct:
   - The vault key is recovered.
   - Normal PIN path is rebuilt.
   - The device is unlocked again.

#### Managing Categories & Passwords

From the **main menu**:

- `[ ADD CATEGORY ]` – create a new category (e.g. “Work”, “Personal”).
- Select a category to open its **password list**.

Inside a **category**:

- Add passwords (`[ ADD PASSWORD ]`).
- Edit category name.
- Delete category (only if empty).

Adding new item:

- create a new label for the password. (e.g "Gmail","Facebook") DO NOT USE USERNAME OR FULL EMAIL.
- `[ AUTO GENERATE ]` – generate a random secure password (recommended).
- `[ MANUAL DEFINE ]` – manually input a password (if you want to you your own).

Inside a **password item**:

- `[ SEND PASSWORD ]` – types the password over USB HID.
- `[ SHOW PASSWORD ]` – display password on screen.
- `[ ROTATE PASSWORD ]` – generate or input a new password; old one is moved to history.
- `[ SHOW ARCHIVES ]` – browse and send/show previous passwords.
- `[ EDIT NAME ]` – rename the entry.
- `[ MOVE TO CATEGORY ]` – move the item to another category.
- `[ DELETE ]` – delete the entry (with confirmation).

#### Setting

Inside setting:

- `[ PASSWORD SETTING ]` – setting UPPERCASE, LOWERCASE, SYMBOL, NUMBER for auto generate.
- `[ UPDATE SECURITY ]` – change your passcode and get new recovery keys also the security settings.
- `[ ACCESS SDCARD ]` – access the SD card to manage files or backups or firmware update.

#### Auto‑Logout

- After 5 minutes of no input, the device:
  - Wipes keys from RAM.
  - Closes the DB.
  - Reboots back to the lock screen.

---

### 6. Accessing the SD Card (MSC Mode)

To back up or inspect the SD card from your computer without disassembling:

1. From **Settings**, choose **`[ ACCESS SDCARD ]`**.
2. The device:
   - Closes the DB.
   - Sets a flag in NVS.
   - Reboots into a dedicated **MSC mode**.
3. In MSC mode:
   - The SD card appears as a USB mass storage device on your PC.
   - You can copy the vault database (e.g. `/sdcard/pocketPass/vault.db`) for backup.
4. When done:
   - Use the on‑device option (e.g. `[ Unmount ]`) or simply reboot.
   - The MSC flag is cleared and the device returns to normal firmware boot.

> Note: Backups are still encrypted. Without the device‑specific secret & keys, the DB alone is not usable.

---

### 7. Firmware Update via SD Card

1. Place the new firmware and signature on the SD card:
   - `/pocketPass/firmware/firmware.bin`
   - `/pocketPass/firmware/firmware.sig` (Base64‑encoded or raw DER)
2. Reboot the device.
3. On boot, the firmware:
   - Verifies the signature using the built‑in ECDSA P‑256 public key.
   - If valid, flashes `firmware.bin` using `Update`.
   - Deletes the firmware files from SD when done.
4. If the signature is invalid:
   - Files are deleted.
   - The update is rejected.

---

## Firmware Updates

Pocket Pass supports **offline firmware updates from the SD card**.  
The bootloader looks for:

- `/pocketPass/firmware/firmware.bin`
- `/pocketPass/firmware/firmware.sig`

on the microSD card. The `.sig` file is an ECDSA P‑256 signature over the SHA‑256 hash of `firmware.bin`. Only correctly signed firmware will be accepted and flashed.

### Where to Download Firmware

You can get official firmware builds from:

- **GitHub Releases**  
  - _Add your releases link here, e.g.:_

I recommend you always download from the **latest tagged version** or the **latest Release**.

### How to Install a Firmware Update

1. **Download the update files**
   - From the `firmware/` folders in this repo or from the Releases page, download:
     - `firmware.bin`
     - `firmware.sig`
   - Make sure both files are from the **same version folder** (e.g. `v1-2-1`).

2. **Prepare the SD card**
   - Power off the device and remove the microSD card.
   - Insert the SD into your computer (you can also use the **“ACCESS SDCARD”** mode from Settings to expose it as USB mass storage).
   - On the SD card, create (if needed) the folder:
     - `/pocketPass/firmware/`

3. **Copy and rename files**
   - Copy the downloaded files into `/pocketPass/firmware/` on the SD card.
   - Ensure the names match exactly:
     - `/pocketPass/firmware/firmware.bin`
     - `/pocketPass/firmware/firmware.sig`
   - There should be **no extra version subfolder** on the SD card; the versioning is only in this Git repository.

4. **Insert SD and reboot**
   - Safely eject the SD card from your computer.
   - Insert it back into the Pocket Pass device.
   - Power up or reboot the device.

5. **Automatic verification & flashing**
   - On boot, the device:
     - Computes the SHA‑256 of `firmware.bin`.
     - Verifies `firmware.sig` using the built‑in ECDSA P‑256 public key.
   - If the signature is **valid**:
     - The firmware is flashed using the Arduino `Update` API.
     - `firmware.bin` and `firmware.sig` are deleted from the SD.
     - The device will reboot into the new firmware.
   - If the signature is **invalid or files are incomplete**:
     - The files are deleted.
     - The update is rejected; the existing firmware stays active.

### Version History


| Version | SD Instructions | Files in Repo |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| v1.2.2 | Copy to `/pocketPass/firmware/` as `firmware.bin` + `firmware.sig` | [`firmware/v1-2-2/`](./firmware/v1-2-2/) |
| v1.2.1 | Copy to `/pocketPass/firmware/` as `firmware.bin` + `firmware.sig` | [`firmware/v1-2-1/`](./firmware/v1-2-1/) |

> **Important:** Never rename the files on the SD card to include the version.  
> The device will only look for the exact names `firmware.bin` and `firmware.sig` in `/pocketPass/firmware/`.
